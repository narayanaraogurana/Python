Ptyhon Notes:
=============

Variables:  Variales are containers for storing data. Variables are nothing but names of memory locations

    Example: a=20
    
Rules for Python variables:

A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
