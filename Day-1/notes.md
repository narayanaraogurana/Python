# Ptyhon Notes:
=============

Variables:  Variales are containers for storing data. Variables are nothing but names of memory locations  in which values are store.

    Example: a=20
    
Rules for Python variables:

A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

Literals: literals are nothing but values.
Example: a=20 here 20 is literals and a is varialbe.

Identifier: Identifier will help to get memory address
===========
a=20
print(id(a))

Data types: Python is dynamically types language..no need to mention datatype in variable declaration.
============

* Data types will decide memory for that value.

Fundamental data types: int, float,  bool, complex
Sequence : str, bytes, bytesarray, range
collection/list: list, tuples
set: set, frozenset
Dict: dict
none: none

Decimal  binary octal hexadecimal

How to read input from users: By using input function, we can give numbers at run time.
